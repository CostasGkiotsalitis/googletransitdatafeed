= Introduction =

Schedule Viewer is a Python program for viewing the contents of a Google Transit Feed Spec feed on a map.  It's a diagnostic program intended for those creating a feed, and as such doesn't include trip planning or other features that are useful to transit riders.

= Installation =

The Schedule Viewer is part of the Transit Feed Distribution. See the [TransitFeedDistribution page about the transit feed distribution] for instructions on installing either the Windows executable or python source.

To run you need:
  * {{{<google_maps_api_key>}}} a Google Maps API key for the address `http://localhost:8765`, available from the [http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html Google Maps API signup page]
  * {{{<feed_file_or_directory>}}} a transit feed file or a directory containing an expanded feed file. If you don't have a feed download one from the PublicFeeds page or read the [http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.htm Google Transit Feed Specification] to create your own.

== Running from source ==
{{{
python schedule_viewer.py --key <google_maps_api_key> --feed_filename <feed_file_or_directory>
}}}

On Windows the python executable is normally installed as `C:\Python25\python`

== Running Windows exe ==

If you installed the Windows exe run the following command
{{{
schedule_viewer.exe --key <google_maps_api_key> --feed_filename <feed_file_or_directory>
}}}
If you run it from Start -> Run include the full path of schedule_viewer.exe and if you are in a command prompt change into the directory containing schedule_viewer.exe.


= Instructions =

Once schedule_viewer has finished loading the feed file it prints a URL. Ignore that URL because it won't work with your Google Maps API key. Instead go to http://localhost:8765/ in your web browser and a page similar to the screen shot above should load.

Click on one of the route names on the left-hand side to see the trip patterns for that route.  The first trip will automatically be selected, and shown on the map.  To see another trip, click a different blue time.  When a trip is selected, some of the source data for that route will be displayed at the bottom of the window.

The yellow icons on the map belong to the currently-selected route/trip; the blue icons are other nearby stops.  You can click on an icon to see the `stop_name` and `stop_id` of a stop, along with the next few stop times for it. If you click on a stop time to see the entire trip.
