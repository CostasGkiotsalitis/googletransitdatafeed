= Introduction =

Schedule Viewer is a Python program for viewing the contents of a Google Transit Feed Spec feed on a map.  It's a diagnostic program intended for those creating a feed, and as such doesn't include trip planning or other features that are useful to transit riders.

= Installation =

The Schedule Viewer is part of the Transit Feed Distribution. See the [TransitFeedDistribution page about the transit feed distribution] for instructions on installing either the Windows executable or python source.

To run you need:
  * {{{<google_maps_api_key>}}} a Google Maps API key for the address `http://localhost:8765`, available from the [http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html Google Maps API signup page]
  * {{{<feed_file_or_directory>}}} a transit feed file or a directory containing an expanded feed file. If you don't have a feed download one from the PublicFeeds page or read the [http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.htm Google Transit Feed Specification] to create your own.

== Running from source ==
{{{
python schedule_viewer.py --key <google_maps_api_key> --feed_filename <feed_file_or_directory>
}}}

On Windows the python executable is normally installed as `C:\Python25\python`

== Running Windows exe ==

If you installed the Windows exe run the following command
{{{
schedule_viewer.exe --key <google_maps_api_key> --feed_filename <feed_file_or_directory>
}}}
If you run it from Start -> Run include the full path of schedule_viewer.exe and if you are in a command prompt change into the directory containing schedule_viewer.exe.


= Instructions =

Once schedule_viewer has finished loading the feed file it prints a URL. Ignore that URL because it won't work with your Google Maps API key. Instead go to http://localhost:8765/ in your web browser and a page similar to the screen shot above should load.

== Exploring stops ==

After you drag the map to a new location with your mouse it will display stops in the current area a transparent blue markers. If there are lots of stops in the map area only a sample will be displayed. To see all the stops you need to zoom in. The map zooms in when double clicked. If you click on a marker it opens a window listing the "stop_name (stop_id)" and the next trips to visit the stop after "Time:" (HH:MM at top left of screen). Click on a trip to display it.

== Exploring routes ==

The left pane lists all the routes in the feed. Click on one of the route names to see the trip patterns (a group of trips that visit the same stops in the same order) for that route. The first trip will automatically be selected, and shown on the map. For each trip pattern the number of stops, number of trips and start times are displayed. For patterns that have many trips only a few start times are displayed. Edit the Time field at the top to look at other start times. To see another trip on the map, click its start time.  When a trip is selected, some of the source data for that route will be displayed at the bottom of the window. Below the source data is a graph that lists every trip of the selected pattern. A steeper line represents faster travel. These lines shouldn't cross unless two buses on the same pattern pass.

The yellow icons on the map belong to the currently-selected route/trip; the blue icons are other nearby stops.  You can click on an icon to see the `stop_name` and `stop_id` of a stop, along with the next few stop times for it. If you click on a stop time to see the entire trip.

The Find Station field will search for all stops that have a name or stop_id containing the string you enter.
