#Transxchange2GoogleTransit Development Environment

= Introduction =
This page contains instructions how to create a development environment to maintain the Transxchange2GoogleTransit converter tool, using Eclipse.

= Details =
1. Download and install Eclipse, from http://www.eclipse.org. (These instructions have been validated with Eclipse 3.5.0, "Galileo")

2. Download and install Java. Many computers already have Java installed. This can be verified by opening a command shell (or equivalent), and call Java:
<pre>java -version</pre>
If Java is installed, the resulting output should display the Java version, such as:
<pre>java version "1.5.0_14"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_14-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_14-b03, mixed mode, sharing)</pre>
The code works with Java 5, or later.

3. Checkout the Transxchange2GoogleTransit source code
As project member, the source code can be checked out with commit privilige, as described in the [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/source/checkout Source tab]. Anybody can check out the source code read only. Use the following syntax to check out the code into the current directory:
<pre>svn checkout http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/Transxchange2GoogleTransit googletransitdatafeed-read-only</pre>
The directory name will drive the Eclipse project name. Rename it, as appropriate.

4. Create new Eclipse project from the checked-out source code
Open Eclipse and select "New" -> "Java Project" from the "File" menu.
Select "Create project from existing source", and navigate to the root directory of the checked-out source code.
Click "Finish".
Verify the project by manually rebuilding the project. Select "Project" -> "Clean", select the project, and hit "OK".
