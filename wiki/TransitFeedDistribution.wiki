#summary A Distribution of python tools

= Introduction =

The TransitFeedDistribution contains several parts, each with their own instructions

  * TransitFeed - a Python module for reading, writing, and validating feeds
  * FeedValidator - a command line tool that checks a Google Transit Feed for problems
  * ScheduleViewer - an application for exploring a feed on a map    

= Download =

== Windows ==

If you just want to run the tools you may download prebuilt exe files from http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list . Look for =transitfeed-<version>exe.zip=. Unzip the contents into an empty directory.

Windows users may also install and run the python source code fetched from our subversion repository http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

== All others ==

For now you must download the source from our subversion repository http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

We need to make a source distribution file and add it to PyPI.

= Changes =
