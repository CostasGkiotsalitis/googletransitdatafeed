#summary A Distribution of python tools

= Introduction =

The TransitFeedDistribution contains several parts, each with its own instructions

  * TransitFeed - a Python module for reading, writing, and validating feeds
  * FeedValidator - a command line tool that checks a Google Transit Feed for problems
  * ScheduleViewer - an application for exploring a feed on a map    

= Download =

You may download the transitfeed distribution as Windows executables, a source tar ball or directly from our Subversion repository.

== Windows Executable ==

If you just want to run the tools you may download prebuilt Windows programs from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list the downloads section]. Download the latest version of `transitfeed-<version>-windows.zip` and unzip the contents into an empty directory.  Then see the ScheduleViewer and FeedValidator pages for further instructions.

== Install source distribution ==

`easy_install transitfeed` will download and install transitfeed and the scripts that come with it.

If you don't have easy_install on your computer you may download `transitfeed-<version>.tar.gz` from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list the downloads section].

==== v1.0.9 ====
feedvalidator outputs html instead of plain text and loads it in a webbrowser. added a directory of example scripts using transitfeed. kmlparser converts kml line into GTFS shape.

==== v1.0.8 ====
Move schedule_viewer data files and marey_graph into package gtfsscheduleviewer so that setup.py installs them in a sensible place. Add a hack so py2exe schedule_viewer can find its data files. schedule_viewer --key option will get key from a file if it exists.

==== v1.0.7 ====
Adds kmlparser and kmlwriter utilities for partially converting feeds from and to Google Earth KML format.  Also includes several validation improvements, particularly to stop times and route_short_name.

==== v1.0b6 ====
Adds a Windows executable for schedule_viewer.

==== v1.0b5 ====
Adds more validation of service_ids.

==== v1.0b4 ====
Further improves line wrapping, improves ID display, limits the number of unused stops shown.

==== v1.0b3 ====
Adds better line wrapping to make the output more pleasant to read.

==== v1.0b2 ====
Adds testing to identify stops that probably refer to the same location because they're close enough together.

==== v1.0b1 ====
First standalone Windows version.
