#summary A Distribution of python tools

= Introduction =

The TransitFeedDistribution contains several parts, each with its own instructions

  * TransitFeed - a Python module for reading, writing, and validating feeds
  * FeedValidator - a command line tool that checks a Google Transit Feed for problems
  * ScheduleViewer - an application for exploring a feed on a map    

= Download =

If you just want to run the tools you may download prebuilt Windows programs from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list the downloads section]. Download the latest version of `transitfeed-<version>-windows.zip` and unzip the contents into an empty directory.  Then see the ScheduleViewer and FeedValidator pages for further instructions.

Windows users may also install and run the python source code fetched from our subversion repository http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

== All others ==

For now you must download the source from our subversion repository http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

We need to make a source distribution file and add it to PyPI.
