#summary A Distribution of python tools

= Introduction =

The TransitFeedDistribution contains several parts, each with its own instructions

  * TransitFeed - a Python module for reading, writing, and validating feeds
  * FeedValidator - a command line tool that checks a Google Transit Feed for problems
  * ScheduleViewer - an application for exploring a feed on a map   
  * [KMLWriter] - an application for plotting a feed's stops in a KML file for viewing in Google Earth 

= Download =

You may download the transitfeed distribution as Windows executables, a source tar ball or directly from our Subversion repository.

== Windows Executable ==

If you just want to run the tools you may download prebuilt Windows programs from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list the downloads section]. Download the latest version of `transitfeed-<version>-windows.zip` and unzip the contents into an empty directory.  Then see the ScheduleViewer and FeedValidator pages for further instructions.

== Install source distribution ==

Some features of the distribution depend on !ElementTree (added to Python's standard library in version 2.5) and pytz. You may need to install these manually.

`easy_install transitfeed` will download and install transitfeed and the scripts that come with it.

If you don't have easy_install on your computer you may download `transitfeed-<version>.tar.gz` from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list the downloads section]. Expand with `tar -xzf transitfeed-<version>.tar.gz`. You may run the tools directly from the expanded directory or run `python2.4 setup.py install`.

== Subversion repository ==

If you want to make changes grab our source from http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python.

= Bugs and feature requests =

Please create a new issue if you find bugs or have a feature requests. Patches released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license are more than welcome! You may contact the developers in the [http://groups.google.com/group/googletransitdatafeed Google Transit Data Feed Google Group].

==== v1.1.5 ====
  * Add examples/filter_unused_stops.py that loads a gtfs file, modifies some things and saves the changes to a new file
  * Fix for

    * Issue 37: transitfeed installed as an egg can interfere with tests
    * Issue 54: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'`
    * Issue 55: feedvalidator.exe error: `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` (crash handler in py2exe)

  * add merge.py as a script; merge.exe is now part of windows binary distribution
  * add examples/google_random_queries.py: outputs a list of random query urls, using stop lat,lng
  * add a crash handler to feedvalidator. this provides a friendly message to users and should make it much easier for us to debug problems

  * Schedule Viewer changes:
    * More accurate display of route names
    * Better support for unicode IDs
    * Stop time interpolation
  * FeedValidator changes:
    * FeedValidator now categorizes issues as either errors or warnings
    * Checks for missing start & end times on trips
    * Warning if the feed has expired or will in the next month

  * Added `--output` switch to set HTML output path and made `-n` switch disable loading of output in browser in FeedValidator.
  * Validation changes:
    * Duplicate schedule_id validation now works
    * Error on stops that don't pick up, drop off, or act as a timepoint
    * Error when day in service period isn't set to "1" or "0"

  * Added a directory of example Python scripts using transitfeed.
  * kmlparser converts KML lines into GTFS shape.
