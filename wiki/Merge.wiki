#How to use the merge tool to combine two GTFS feeds

= Introduction =

In many cases GTFS users have a need to combine two feeds that represent different service periods for their service. For example, an agency that changes their schedule quarterly might have one GTFS file for the January-March period and another for the April-June period. The merge tool helps users combine these two files so that data can be updated without having any gaps in service.

= Using Merge =

The merge tool is intended to merges schedules. New stops will be handled but some changes like moving stops may cause problems. 

== On Windows ==
First download the compiled version of transittools for Windows from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list here]. Unpack the zip file to some location - for the purposes of this document let's assume the zip file is unpacked to `C:\` so all the files are in `C:\transitfeed-windows-binary-1.2.0`. The merge tool is `merge.exe`.

Open a command line window by going to the Start menu, selecting "Run...", typing `cmd` and press enter. Go to the directory where you have the GTFS files you want to merge using the `cd` command. If the files are in `c:\gtfs_files` type `cd \gtfs_files'. 

To merge two feed files, you pass the name of the two files on the command line along with the name of the new merged GTFS file. 

For example, if the two feed files are `jan_schedule.zip` and `feb_schedule.zip` then you use the following command line:

`\transitfeed-windows-binary-1.2.0\merge jan_schedule.zip feb_schedule.zip merged_schedule.zip`

If there are no errors you will have a new file, `merged_schedule.zip` which will contain the schedule for both January and February.

== Using Python ==

If you're using the Python version of the merge tool simply run `python merge.py old_schedule.zip new_schedule.zip merged_schedule.zip`. The transittools package can either by downloaded from [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list here] or installed using easy_install: `easy_install transitfeed`
