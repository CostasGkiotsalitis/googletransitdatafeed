#summary Getting your change reviewed and submitted to trunk

= Introduction =

To help us coordinate our work we would like at least one person other than the writer to review each change before it is added to the trunk. The [http://codereview.appspot.com/ Rietveld Code Review Tool] has [http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/CodeReviewHelp its own instructions]. This page describes things specific to the transitfeed project.

== Get source ==

See the Source tab above for instructions on downloading the source. Please checkout and modify the trunk to make it as easy as possible to merge your changes into the main distribution.

== Legal stuff ==

Our project uses the [http://www.apache.org/licenses/ Apache License 2.0]. To ease distribution your contributions must be released under the same terms. You may release each change explicitly under the license or mail googletransitdatafeed@googlegroups.com saying that all your modifications to the transitfeed distribution may be released under the same terms as transitfeed itself.

== Make and test changes ==

Before you request a review, you should ensure that all the unit tests pass.  You'll want a copy of the [http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/ nose] tool for Python.  Once you have that installed, you can just run
{{{
$ nosetests
}}}
from the `trunk/python` directory to run all the tests in the project.

Note that in order to pass all the tests, you'll need to install some extra Python packages to support optional features of the code:
  * [http://pytz.sourceforge.net/ pytz]
  * [http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm elementtree] (if running Python 2.4)
Both of these should be available through `easy_install`.

If you've added new tests to your project, it's good to make sure that you've seen them fail (so that you know that they're being run at all).  If necessary, temporarily break the code that the tests check to ensure that they fail in that case.

==Request a review==

When you want someone to review your code make a new issue with your changes, add googletransitdatafeed@googlegroups.com to the list of reviewers and use the code review interface to mail a request for a review.

==Commit change to the trunk==

Once your reviewer has given you a "looks good", you're ready to land the code.  When you are ready to merge your branch into the trunk check that you are only submitting the expected changes.
