= Introduction =

The feedvalidator is a command line tool that checks a Google Transit Feed for problems.  Running it on your transit data feed and fixing the issues that it finds can save you from display and routing problems down the road.

= Windows standalone version =

We provide a Windows executable version for convenience; if you're running Windows, you should use this one.  To get it, download [http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/files/feedvalidator-1.0b4.zip feedvalidator-1.0b4.zip] from the [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/list project download page].

Once you have it downloaded and unzipped, there are a few ways to run it:

==== Easiest ====
Drag a feed zip file or directory onto `feedvalidator.exe`.  A window will pop up with the result of the validation test:

==== Intermediate ====
Double-click `feedvalidator.exe`.  A window will pop up and ask you to enter the location of your feed file or directory.  You can type it in, or just drag a feed file or directory onto the window and hit Enter.

==== Expert ====
Go to the Windows command prompt, and type: `feedvalidator <name of feed file or directory>`.  If you want to avoid the prompt at the end of the validation, use the `--noprompt` parameter.

= Python source code version =

Use this version if you're on Mac OS X or Linux.

Before you run the feed validator you must install Python 2.4 or 2.5. You can download it from http://www.python.org/download/

Fetch the feedvalidator from our source code repository (see Source tab above) or by directly downloading http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/feedvalidator.py and http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/transitfeed.py to the same directory.

== Running ==

Run the feed validator as
{{{
feedvalidator.py <feed filename>
}}}

The warning "Timezone not checked (install pytz package for timezone validation)" is normal. feedvalidator can not check the spelling of the agency_timezone until you install the pytz package.


== Extra help for Windows XP/2000 users ==

Open a new Command Prompt window. Change into the directory containing feedvalidator.py and  transitfeed.py (Hint: type "cd " without quotes and drag the icon of the folder into command prompt window). Run feedvalidator.py <feed filename>. If you don't want to type the feed filename try dragging it into the command prompt window.
