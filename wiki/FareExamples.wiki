#summary Illustrates how to implement different fare structures with the GTFS

= Introduction =

The fare_attributes.txt and fare_rules.txt files in the Google Transit Feed Specification can be confusing. The following examples work through different kinds of fare structures and show how to represent them in a Google transit feed.

= Examples =

== All trips have the same fare == 

This is the simplest case. 

The Demo Transit agency has the following fare structure:
   * riders pay 1$ on boarding (price='1',currency='USD', payment_method='0')
   * passengers can ride as long as they like. 
   * any change in vehicles requires a new fare. (transfers='0')

Since all trips have the same fare, Demo Transit can omit fare_rules.txt. 

{{{
*fare_attributes.txt*

fare_id,price,currency_type,payment_method,transfers
only_fare,1.00,USD,0,0
}}}
