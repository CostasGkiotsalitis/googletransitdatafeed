#summary This page serves as a catalog of the errors and warnings returned by the FeedValidator utility.

= Errors =

==== File _file name_ is not found (E1) ====
==== File _file name_ is empty (E2) ====
==== Couldn't find a feed named _feed name_ (E3) ====
==== The feed named _feed name_ had an unknown format: feeds should be either .zip files or directories. (E4) ====
==== Files must be encoded in utf-8 and may not contain any null bytes (0x00). (E5) ====
==== Missing column _column name_ in file _file name_ (E6) ====
==== Missing value for column _column name_ (E7) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field _column name_ (E8) ====
==== Duplicate ID _value_ in column _column name_ (E9) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field stop_desc.  stop_desc should not be the same as stop_name (E10) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_short_name.  Both route_short_name and route_long name are blank. (E10) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_desc.  route_desc shouldn't be the same as route_short_name or route_long_name (E11) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_color.  route_color should be a valid color description which consists of 6 hexadecimal characters representing the RGB values. Example: 44AA06 (E12) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_text_color.  route_text_color should be a valid color description, which consists of 6 hexadecimal characters representing the RGB values. Example: 44AA06 (E13) ====



= Warnings =

==== Unrecognized column _column name_ in file _file name_.  This might be a misspelled column name (capitalization matters!). Or it could be extra information (such as a proposed feed extension) that the validator doesn't know about yet. Extra information is fine; this warning is here to catch misspelled optional column names. (W1) ====
==== _stop name_ (ID _stop id_) isn't used in any trips (W2) ====
==== This feed expired on _date_ (W3) ====
==== This feed will soon expire, on _date_ (W4) ====
==== Each line must end with CR LF or LF except for the last line of the file. This line ends with _line ending example_. (W5) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field stop_lat.  Stop location too close to 0, 0 (W6) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_short_name.  This route_short_name is relatively long, which probably means that it contains a place name.  You should only use this field to hold a short code that riders use to identify a route.  If this route doesn't have such a code, it's OK to leave this field empty. (W7) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_short_name.  route_long_name shouldn't contain the route_short_name value, as both fields are often displayed side-by-side. (W8) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_short_name.  route_long_name shouldn't be the same the route_short_name value, as both fields are often displayed side-by-side.  It's OK to omit either the short or long name (but not both). (W9) ====
==== Invalid value _value_ in field route_color.  The route_text_color and route_color should be set to contrasting colors, as they are used as the text and background color (respectively) for displaying route names.  When left blank, route_text_color defaults to 000000 (black) and route_color defaults to FFFFFF (white).  A common source of issues here is setting route_color to a dark color, while leaving route_text_color set to black.  In this case, route_text_color should be set to a lighter color like FFFFFF to ensure a legible contrast between the two. (W10) ====
