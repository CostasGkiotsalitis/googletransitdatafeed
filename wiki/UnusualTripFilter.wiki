#summary Instructions for unusual_trip_filter

= Introduction =

= Details =

The pattern of a trip is the sequence of stops it visits. By default a trip is marked as unusual if its pattern is used by less than 10% of the trips of that route. unusual_trip_filter only works with GTFS files that validate without any warnings or errors.
