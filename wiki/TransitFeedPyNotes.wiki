= Things to validate =

In sections that could be checked at the same time, starting with low level byte things, working towards high level where relations between multiple rows or objects matter.

== File format ==
  * correct eol
  * valid utf-8
  * correct csv format
  * same number of columns on each line

== GTFS tables ==
  * all required tables present
  * in each present table the required columns are present
  * warn about unknown tables
  * warn about unknown columns

== Individual values ==

These can be checked when parsing a row from a table or when assigning a value to an attribute, for example `stop.stop_lat = 45.832`. When are strings converted to other types? IE do we allow `stop = Stop(lat="45.832")` or `stop.stop_lat = "45.832"`?

  * correct format for type. Is it a valid time, date, float etc?
  * in valid range, abs(latitude) < 90, abs(longitude) < 180

== Consistent row/object ==

These could be checked during __init__ if it is given all values which happens in the common case of loading from a file. Checking in __setattr__ doesn't seem like a great idea because the order that attributes are set may determine if a problem is reported. For example location_type and parent_id would need to be changed atomically.
  * arr and dep time both present or absent
  * stop not near 0,0
  * parent_id only set with correct location_type
  * route_short_name not in route_long_name
