This page documents the revisions that the [http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.htm Google Transit Feed Specification] has had over its history.

== April 9, 2007 ==
  * Added section on [http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.htm#transitFeedSubmit submitting a feed].
  * Added the [http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.htm#transitAgencyExample Demo Transit Agency Example] feed and live demo.
  * Added note that `calendar.txt` can be omitted if all the service dates are defined in `calendar_dates.txt`.
  * Made the `agency_id` field optional in feeds containing only one agency.  This allows existing feeds without `agency_id` to remain valid.
  * Added fuller specification of `agency_url`, `stop_url`, and `route_url`, and additional example values for those fields.
  * Added `6` (Gondola) and `7` (Funicular) as valid `route_type` values.

==== March 8, 2007 ====
Minor edit to move the `stop_url` field from `stop_times.txt`, where it was incorrectly specified in the Feb. 28 update, to `stops.txt`, where it belongs.

==== March 5, 2007 ====
Minor edit to clarify the description of the `route_long_name` field.
